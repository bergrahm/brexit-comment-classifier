# Brexit Comment Classifier
Hello!

I am a Software Engineering Student that is interested in Machine Learning and have created this project for fun. The aim for this repository is mainly personal development, trying out different techniques and sharing some insights that I accumulate on the way. Enjoy!

## Get Started

This repository contains files that make use of the sklearn API to classify whether comments found on the internet regarding Brexit are either for (1) or against (0) it.

Before we being, it's worth mentioning that the code was written in Python version 3.6, and thus to avoid unecessary errors it is recommended that you have 3.6 or later version installed. I've not tested if this walkthrough runs smoothly on older versions (I guess it should, but who knows).

Additionally, if you have not done so yet, this repository makes use of the sklearn API and requires you to make use of it too in order to run it successfully. So if you have not done so yet, try to following command in your terminal:
```
$ pip install sklearn
```
On successful installation, you now have access to the library that will be used for this implementation.
